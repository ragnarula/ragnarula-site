+++
I am a student in my final year of a four year Computer Science MSci course at City, University of London. I like to write code to build apps, websites and distributed systems, as well as playing with technologies like virtualization and containers (basically anything involving computers). I also occasionally build electronic buttons to automate sound and light control for theatre companies, and have been known to do some sound engineering for musicians.

I have a strong background in theoretical computer science, with Java, Scala, C++ and Python being my weapons of choice for solving most programming problems. I also have an interest in mathematics and machine learning algorithms, and spend most of my spare time reading around the topic.
