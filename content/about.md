title = "About Me"

+++
I have a strong background in theoretical computer science, with Java, Scala, C++ and Python being my weapons of choice for solving most programming problems. My clients range from theatre companies and event technology providers to musicians. I also have an interest in mathematics and machine learning algorithms, and spend most of my spare time reading around the topic.

I am currently in the final year of a four year Computer Science MSci course at City, University of London. Along side working and studying I like to work on my own side projects like apps, websites and real time distributed systems, as well as spending time playing with technologies like virtualization and containers (basically anything involving computers).
