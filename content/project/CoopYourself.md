CoopYourself is a promotional Android app made for [Lost Watch Theatre Company](http://www.lostwatchtheatre.co.uk/) with their latest show [Flew the Coop](http://www.lostwatchtheatre.co.uk/flew-the-coop/4592487369). The app is created in Android Studio and makes use of the Canvas API for custom drawing and multi touch support on mobile devices.

Lost Watch were keen to promote their new show by launching an app that would allow fans to create share their own version of the iconic poster image for the show. The app lets fans take or load an image and add a pair of 'dots' to cover the eyes. The dots can be repositioned, scaled, colored and rotated (in pairs). Implementing this required programming gesture detection as well as multi point touch for drag and drop.

It was a challenging project for a first app, with a learning curve that included the Android API, multiple hidpi resolution support, multiple screen size support, Android permissions structure and Play store submission as well as the gesture detection and drag and drop support already mentioned.

An iOS version may be in the works for the future, for which I would consider factoring out some of the code to C++ in order to make as much of it as possible cross-platform.
